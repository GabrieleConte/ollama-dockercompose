# Ollama Docker Compose Setup

Welcome to the Ollama Docker Compose Setup! This project simplifies the deployment of Ollama using Docker Compose, making it easy to run Ollama with all its dependencies in a containerized environment.
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

#### GPU Support (Optional)

If you have a GPU and want to leverage its power within a Docker container, follow these steps to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit

# Configure NVIDIA Container Toolkit
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
sudo systemctl restart docker

# Test GPU integration
docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.5.2-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi
```

### Configuration

1. Clone the Docker Compose repository:


2. Change to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ollama-docker
    ```
3. Create a secrets file named like this:
    .env.secrets (can be blank)

## Usage

Start Ollama and its dependencies using Docker Compose:

if gpu is configured
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-ollama-gpu.yaml up -d
```

else
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to access Ollama-webui.

### Model Installation

Change the model/embedding names inside .env.config 

### Explore Langchain/Llamaindex and Ollama

You can explore Langchain/Lamaindex integrations with Ollama within the project. A second container named **app** has been created for this purpose. Inside, you'll find some examples.

### Devcontainer and Virtual Environment

The **app** container serves as a devcontainer, allowing you to boot into it for experimentation. Additionally, the run.sh file contains code to set up a virtual environment if you prefer not to use Docker for your development environment.
if you have vs code and the `Remote Development¬¥ extension simply opening this project from the root will make vscode ask you to reopen in container
## Stop and Cleanup

To stop the containers and remove the network:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
